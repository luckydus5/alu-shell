## üìö Resources

Read or watch:

- Expansions  
- Shell Arithmetic  
- Variables  
- Shell initialization files  
- The alias Command  
- Technical Writing  

**man or help:**

## üéØ Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I should be able to explain to anyone (without Google):

### General
- What happens when you type `$ ls -l *.txt`

### Shell Initialization Files
- What are the `/etc/profile` file and the `/etc/profile.d` directory  
- What is the `~/.bashrc` file  

### Variables
- What is the difference between a local and a global variable  
- What is a reserved variable  
- How to create, update and delete shell variables  
- Roles of the following reserved variables: `HOME`, `PATH`, `PS1`  
- What are special parameters  
- What is the special parameter `$?`  

### Expansions
- What is expansion and how to use it  
- Difference between single and double quotes, and how to use them properly  
- How to do command substitution with `$()` and backticks  

### Shell Arithmetic
- How to perform arithmetic operations with the shell  

### The alias Command
- How to create an alias  
- How to list aliases  
- How to temporarily disable an alias  

### Other help pages
- How to execute commands from a file in the current shell

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- Scripts will be tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**  
- Scripts must be exactly **two lines long** (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)  
- All files must end with a **new line**  
- First line of all files:  
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
